Program Description: ShopNow Tech Gadgets Web Page

This HTML program builds a responsive and visually appealing homepage for ShopNow, an e-commerce platform that offers stylish tech gadgets such as headphones, smartwatches, and wireless mice. The page is designed with user experience, performance, and accessibility in mind.

Purpose:

The main goal of this program is to provide a clean, informative, and interactive user interface for visitors interested in browsing or purchasing tech products online. It acts as a landing page that introduces the brand, highlights its best-selling products, and offers easy navigation to other pages like products, contact, and more details.

Key Features:

✅ Metadata and SEO Optimization:

* The `<head>` section includes meta tags for description, author, and Open Graph data (title, image, type), which helps optimize how the site appears on search engines and social media platforms.

✅ Responsive Design:

* The use of the `<meta name="viewport">` tag ensures that the website is mobile-friendly and adjusts its layout based on the device screen size.

✅ *Dark Mode Toggle:*

* A JavaScript-based button allows users to toggle between light and dark themes by adding or removing a `dark-mode` class from the `<body>` tag.

✅ *Semantic Layout:*

* Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) improve the page’s structure, accessibility, and maintainability.

✅ *Interactive Navigation:*

* A navigation bar at the top provides quick links to internal and external pages like About, Products, and Contact, enhancing usability.

✅ *Product Listings:

* A featured section displays three highlighted products with:

  * Images
  * Ratings (using star emojis)
  * Pricing (including a strikethrough old price)
  * "Buy Now" buttons that link to individual product detail pages

✅ *Performance Optimizations:*

* All images use `loading="lazy"` to improve page load time by only loading images when they enter the viewport.

✅ Accessibility:

* Use of `alt` attributes on all images and `aria-label` on interactive buttons ensures screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users.

*Technologies Used:*

*HTML5*: For structure and content.
*CSS (External)*: Linked via `styles.css` for visual styling (assumed to include responsive and dark mode styles).
*Google Fonts*: For modern typography.
*JavaScript*: For the dark mode toggle functionality.
